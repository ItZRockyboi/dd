        My school is a very big one and it has a very modern canteen. It is perhaps the most popular place in the school. It becomes very busy during the break times very difficult to find a seat to sit on during those times, so we have to stand and eat.

        Our school canteen is very well equipped. One can buy almost every kind of snack there, like samosas, chips, sandwiches, sweet, cakes etc. They are prepared in very hygienic surroundings by our school cook, and tables to sit on and eat, and ovens to keep the food warm. There is also a soda fountain which is Very popular among the older students.
        
        All the students love to sit in the canteen and discuss the events of the day. The noise level is always very high in the canteen as everyone is shouting to make himself heard. There are notice boards and suggestion boxes which all students are freely. There is also a separate enclosure for teachers. The cook charges very reasonable rates from us.
        
        I think that the school canteen is my favorite place in the school. I always enjoy myself there, and look forward to the recess when I can rush to the canteen with my friends.

        In this system, our Biometric time and attendance machines are used to capture the attendance of the child. This can be done using RFID cards, the fingerprint of the child, face recognition technology. This information is transmitted to the server automatically and from where the SMS is pushed to the parent mobile using the SMS Gateway. We use the world-class gateway for sending SMS. The complete attendance is collected and sent to the parentâ€™s mobile. School gets an option to send customized SMS with the name of the child to prevent confusion in case of multiple children of a parent. Even absent SMS can be sent after a particular time intimating parent. This complete process of sending Attendance SMS is automatic. There is no manual process required.
